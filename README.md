# 💻 Web Playground

This repository documents the small web projects I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to leave a lasting reminder of my progress for the future.

### [Weather & Outfit Suggester](weather-and-outfits/)

This folder holds the source code for one of the Javascript projects i like most. It is a dynamic web application that automatically detects the user's location, fetches real-time weather data, and suggests a logical outfit combination (Outerwear + Top + Bottom) based on the temperature.

* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (CSS Grid & Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript (Classes, Async/Await, Fetch API), OpenWeatherMap API, GeoJS API.
* **Note:** This project focuses on clean architecture and using APIs. I didn't focused too much in designing, there can be updates. 

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | **Fully responsive design using CSS Grid. Optimized for mobile and desktop screens.** |
| **Features** | **Location detection (IP-based), real-time temperature fetching, and a algorithm that filters clothe objects based on thermal properties.** |

### [Terminal Portfolio](terminal-theme-portfolio/)

This folder holds the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to look and feel like a developer's command-line interface. My goal was to create an interactive experience using pure JavaScript logic and CSS layouts, avoiding any frameworks.


* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript 
* **Note:** I wanted to use event listeners and dom manipulation in javascript.

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | **Works good on big or small screens without problem.** |
| **Features** | **Supports commands like `help`, `about`, `projects`. Try `sudo rm -rf` at your own risk :)** |
