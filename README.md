# 💻 Web Playground

This repository is a collection of small web projects I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to apply the technologies I learn and develop my skills in writing clean, well-organized code.

### [Portfolio Site](portfolio-site/)

This folder holds the source code for an simple example of a portfolio website. 


* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (using Media Queries for responsiveness), JavaScript
* **Note:** Nothing too fancy, just an experiment to challange myself

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | **Works good on mobile and laptops, tablets are still a work in progress though** |

### 📟 [Terminal Portfolio](terminal-theme-portfolio/)

This folder holds the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to look and feel like a developer's command-line interface. My goal was to create an interactive experience using pure JavaScript logic and CSS layouts, avoiding any frameworks.


* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
* **Note:** I tried to use event listeners javascript functions.

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | **Works good on big or small screens without problem.** |
| **Features** | **Supports commands like `help`, `about`, `projects`. Try `sudo rm -rf` at your own risk :)** |
