# 💻 Small Web Projects

This repository is a collection of small web projects I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to apply the technologies I learn and develop my skills in writing clean, well-organized code.

### [Portfolio Site](portfolio-site/)

This folder holds the source code for my personal portfolio website.

* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (using Media Queries for responsiveness), JavaScript.
* **Goal:** To create a clean, responsive user interface that works smoothly on both large and small screens.
